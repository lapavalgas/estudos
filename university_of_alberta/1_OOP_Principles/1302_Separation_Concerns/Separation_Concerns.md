# Separation of Concerns | Design Principles


## Concern
**Concern** is a very general notion, basically it is anything that matters in providing a solution to a problem.

That separation of concerns, is a key idea that applies throughout object oriented modelling and programming. The concerns that matter are addressed separately when applying the design principles of **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **decomposition**, and **generalization**. Each concept in the problem space leads to a separate **abstraction** with its own relevant attributes and behaviors. These attributes and behaviors are **encapsulated** into their own section of code called a class. The view of a class by the rest of the system and its implementation are separated. So that the details of implementation can change, while the view through an interface can stay the same. A whole class can also be **decomposed** into multiple classes. We may recognize commonalities among classes, which are then separated and **generalized** into a super class. *Separation of concerns is an ongoing process throughout the design process*.
