# OOP : Abstraction | Expressing Design Structure

 Abstraction is the idea of simplifying a concept in the problem domain to its essentials within some context. Abstraction allows you to better understand a concept by breaking it down into a simplified description that ignores unimportant details. You can first apply abstraction at the design level using UML Class Diagrams then eventually convert the design into code.
