# OOP : Generalization Inheritance | Expressing Design Structure

The inheritance is an way to exclude the redundant code, because the subclasses inherit the attributes and methods. And the subclasses can just overwrite what is needed and implements new rules.

In UML class diagram is used an ' # ' to represent the **Protected** modify, or to explicit that the attributes or methods protected can be accessed by: 1. class itself, 2. all subclasses and 3. all classes within the same package.

In Java we can have just one inheritance. But can have how many subclasses are necessarily. And is used the keyword ' extends ' to do an inheritance.
