# OOP : Encapsulation | Expressing Design Structure

Encapsulation is involves in three ideas. First, you bundle data, and functions that manipulate the data, into a self-contained object. Second, you can expose certain data and functions of that object, which can be accessed from other objects. Third, you can restrict access to certain data and functions to only within that object. This can ve achieved by the Getters and Setters methods.

With encapsulation we can just care about the interfaces between classes and nothing more. If modify the classes attributes or methods and does not modify the interfaces (or input and output of data), the changes do not will cause fails in softwares.
